Topics
======
Representation of signals: digitisation - sampling - quantification - analogue restitution.
Modeling and control of dynamic systems  
1) Analysis and characterization of continuous and discrete-time signals - Fourier, Laplace, z-transforms - sampling and Shannon condition. 
2) Modeling and representation of continuous time and discrete time invariant linear dynamic systems - transfer function, state space - Poles, zeros, stability - Time and frequency responses - Sampling - Simulation - First order and second order systems 
3) Control of SISO linear systems - Definition of the control problem - Towards model inversion, through high gain control - From open loop control to closed loop control. - Two degrees of freedom control (compensation and pre-compensation) - What properties are imposed on the closed loop. 
4) Nominal stability and robust stability of the closed loop. - Nominal stability: classic criteria (Routh, Nyquist). - Robust stability: stability margins - Robust stability: robust stability jigs.
5) Nominal stability and robust performance of the closed loop. - Nominal performances in regulation - Nominal performances in servoing - What robust performances to expect, - Performance templates and performance/stability trade-off 
6) PID type regulators. - Descriptions of (exact or approximate) PID type controllers - How/why do these controllers meet the stability and performance requirements (nominal and robust) to be provided to the closed loop.
